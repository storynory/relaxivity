Humare kahan gaye where have you gone

Tujh ko bula rahe hain Your loved ones are calling you
Tujh ko bula rahe hain yeh Your loved ones are calling you

Pyare kahan gaye where have you gone

Zahir hue thay jism par dhage guna mere
Your body bore the marks of our sins

Dukh se bhare salibi
The sight of your pain on the cross

The sight of your pain on the cross

Nazare kahan gaye

 Rahe najaat paakay kiun gumrah tu ho gaye

Oh sinner after finding your way to Salvation, why did you lose your way

Rahe najaat paakay kiun gumrah tu ho gaye
Oh sinner after finding your way to Salvation, why did you lose your way

Nazdeek aake aaj
So close to redemption

So close to redemption

Kinaare kahan gaye
Where is it all gone
