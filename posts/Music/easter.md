Munji masiha shaafi Our Saviour Christ
Munji masiha shaafi Our Saviour Christ

Humare kahan gaye where have you gone

Tujh ko bula rahe hain Your loved ones are calling you
Tujh ko bula rahe hain yeh Your loved ones are calling you

Pyare kahan gaye where have you gone

Munji masiha shaafi Our Saviour Christ

1. Zahir hue thay jism par dhage guna mere
Your body bore the marks of our sins

Zahir hue thay jism par dhage guna mere
Your body bore the marks of our sins

Dukh se bhare salibi
The sight of your pain on the cross

Dukh se bhare salibi
The sight of your pain on the cross

Nazare kahan gaye
Is gone

Munji masiha shaafi
Our Saviour Christ

2. Kehate thay jaan kar denge aapni nisar hum
They said that they will sacrifice their lives for you

Kehate thay jaan kar denge aapni nisar hum
They said that they will sacrifice their lives for you

Shah-gird thay masih ke
Your faithful disciples

Shah-gird thay masih ke jo
Your faithful disciples

Sarey kahan gaye
Where are they now

Shah-gird thay masih ke jo
Your faithful disciples

Sarey kahan gaye
Where are they now

Munji masiha shaafi
Our Saviour Christ

3. Rahe najaat paakay kiun gumrah tu ho gaye
Oh sinner after finding your way to Salvation, why did you lose your way

Rahe najaat paakay kiun gumrah tu ho gaye
Oh sinner after finding your way to Salvation, why did you lose your way

Nazdeek aake aaj
So close to redemption

Nazdeek aake aaj
So close to redemption

Kinaare kahan gaye
Where is it all gone

Munji masiha shaafi
Munji masiha shaafi Our Saviour Christ

Humare kahan gaye where have you gone
Tujh ko bula rahe hain 
Your loved ones are calling you

Tujh ko bula rahe hain yeh 
Your loved ones are calling you

Pyare kahan gaye where have you gone
Munji masiha shaafi Our Saviour Christ
