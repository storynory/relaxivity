The Famous prayer of St Francis with some extra lines

Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
where there is sadness, joy.
O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek
to be consoled as to console,
to be understood as to understand,
to be loved as to love.
For it is in giving that we receive,
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned,
and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.\
\
Lord, make me a vessel of your grace:
where there is envy, let me sow contentment;
where there is fear, courage;
where there is strife, unity;
where there is ignorance, wisdom;
where there is want, fulfilment;
where there is turmoil, serenity.

O heavenly Guide, teach me to embrace
not just the joy but also the pain,
to find strength not in pride but in humility,
to discover wealth not in possessions but in simplicity.
