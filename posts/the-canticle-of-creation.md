When St Francis of Assisi was ageing and going blind, he wrote these words: a celebration of his brothers and sisters, the Sun, the Moon, Light, Animals, flowers, Fire and Water - all of them God's creations.\
\
The words are some of the most moving and elemental ever written. We are releasing our serene version in time for the Feast of St Francis on October 4th.

Look out for our upcoming biographies of St Francis on ttps://relaxivity.app and https://storynory.com, also in all good podcast apps. Also known as "Laudes Creaturarum", or "Canticle of the Sun" or the "Canticle of the Creatures". Here's G.K. Chesterton's translation:

The Canticle of the Creatures

O most high, almighty, good Lord God,

to thee belong praise, glory, honour, and all blessing.

Praised be my Lord God with all his creatures,

and especially our brother the sun, who brings us the day and gives us light. He is bright and shining with great splendour,

O Lord, he is a sign to thee.

Praised be my Lord for our sister the moon, and for the stars which he has set clear and lovely in the sky. Praised be my

Lord for our brother the wind, and for air and cloud, calms and all weather, by which thou upholdest life in all creatures.

Praised be my Lord for our sister water, who is very serviceable to us and humble and precious and clean.

Praised be my Lord for our brother fire, through whom thou givest us light in the darkness; he is bright and pleasant and very mighty and strong.

Praised be my Lord for our mother the earth, which sustains us and keeps us and brings forth diverse fruits and flowers of many colours, and grass.

Praised be my Lord for all those who pardon one another for his loveâ€™s sake, and who endure weakness and tribulation;

blessed are they who peaceably endure, for thou,

O most Highest, shalt give them a crown.

Praised be my Lord for our sister, the death of the body, from which no living man can flee.

Woe to him who dies in mortal sin; blessed are they who are found walking by thy most holy will, for the second death shall have no power to do them harm.

Praise ye and bless the Lord, and give thanks unto him and serve him with great humility.
