But why by flood ? you might ask well
And now the reason for this I shall tell 

Because if you recall when the giants were in revolt  
Jove killed them all with a single thunderbolt

But Mankind had such lecherous habits
That they had managed to multiply just like rabbits

It would take more than a bolt or two to blow them   away
In one great holocaust of a holy doomsday


Each bolt that Jove held was like a nuclear bomb
He could not overuse them -  something might go wrong 

What he feared was an explosion with results that were perverse
For example, He might blow up Heaven, or still worse, the whole universe 

For there is a day that at the start of time was allotted
When all of creation shall be blotted 
Out  
For ever
And to trigger that Doom, that’s not clever.  

 
He thought for a long time, 
With murder on his mind
Pestilence, famine, flood… yes water!
That was the weapon he chose for his slaughter. 

For when it comes to the weather, I’m the Lord and Master
I foresee the future,  I’m a true climate forecaster 
For the next 40 days,  expect rain that will not relent
And of all the winds , only one shall  give vent


Now the wettest of the winds by far is the South
When he’s drunk he howls with a cry from his mouth
That is all wrapped up in a wine stained beard
And all his hair flies wet, wild and weird
And all  his clothes are  heavy with damp and drips
As he wails and whistles, and spits from his lips
And when he soars on his wide sodden wings
Torrents and downpours of piss are all that he brings

So this South Wind by Jove was sent
With only the wettest and worst intent
His orders were to pick a fight
And not to worry if he was wrong or right
LP
Heyyou looking funny at me?
I’ll give you what for, you’ll soon see

And then he punched  the black clouds packed with rain
And when they fought back he struck them again, and again

Bang!  crash!  flash!  Down it poured 
And when  the humans studied the skies they were shocked and awed 
By the sudden drunken  armies of rowdy clouds 
That warred, fought, and thundered out loud

And down on the ground the destruction was wrought
The crops were flattened and a year’s toil brought to naught

But still the god was dissatisfied with his dire damnation
Until he had wrecked a complete ruination
So he called on Neptune the divine Lord of the Sea
And said, “Hey, Bro, it’s time to bring brotherly love to me!”

And Neptune knows exactly what needs to be done
And he trembles and quakes and rages and wakes ~
~ Up all the deep down depths of the seas and the lakes
And he trumpets his command for the earth’s waters to run
Bursting the borders of every  river, sea and lake
And the rapid rivers rush relentlessly on
And the tidal waves of water carry all in their wake
Houses, farms, and the strongest forts are soon gone
The holiest temple and the most sacred sight
Have no power to resist the tide’s terrible might
Until all the land and the sea are washed in one vast waste
A desolate destruction wrought upon those who were disgraced

Save on the surface,  here there,  and now and again
A little boat was tossed carrying a few drenched and exhausted men
And a desperate tiger swam by the side of a sheep
Unable to put his paw down in the waters that were deep
And the wandering birds winged their way through the damp air
Searching for trees or mountain tops in their despair
And way down below the waves swam wondering nymphs
Who all around their watery wonderlands might glimpse 
Houses and temples and pillars and towers
The tops of trees and their ancient bowers 
And following along a fully submerged street
A darting dolphin they might meet 
For the whole of mankind’s shelters of old
Were now full of fish if the truth be told

And when the sky god saw that sea and land were now as one
He clapped his hands together and thundered, “Job Well Done!”
And at last it was time for Triton,  the sea god’s one and only son
To trumpet on his conch shell and command the floods to be gone
And the watery armies that over the world were arrayed
Heard the trumpet sound and they swiftly obeyed
Receding back to leave a vast, desolate and silent land
And empty houses that were once full and crammed

Only two humans of all the millions had managed to cling to life
Deucalian was the sole man left, and Pyrrha was his wife
And he said to she: Dearest companion of our sacred marriage bed
What are we to do now that all the rest of humankind is dead?
And she had no answer so they both wept and cried
Until they decided one last prayer was to be tried

To the inimical divine powers that were minded to destroy
Their humblest entreaties they decided to employ

To Themis, they prayed, and in her they placed their trust
A rare goddess, who is said to love all that is just

And the Divine lady heard the two lost and lonely souls 
And informed them how they might heal and become whole 
What you must do, she said, is to dig up the bones of your oldest mother
And toss them behind you, this is the way, and there is no other.

Pah, said Deucalion, what kind of advice is that?
I refuse to dig up my  mother, and that’s flat

Hold on Dear , said Pyrrha,  For this is surely a sphinx like trick
One of those riddles that taken literally is quite sick

If you want to foretell the future and not be wrong
You must know that oracles do not speak with straight tongue

When she says that we must dig up mother’s bones
What she really means is that we must pick up some stones

Because Gia, the goddess of nature and the earth
Was the first divine mother who to us gave birth

And Deucalion knew straight away that his wife was right
And rejoiced that he had married a woman who was so bright

And so they picked up a whole pile of  rocks and stones
And tossed them over their shoulders in the place of bones

And as each stone landed on the ground with a thud
First it became soft and malleable like mud

And slowly it changed and took on a new form
With skin and bones and blood that was warm
And some stones morphed into the shape of  men
Those were the ones  thrown by Deucalion
And as you might guess, Pyrrha pitched the rest
And they  took the form of women with breasts

And maybe you have heard something like this myth before. 
Noah, Gilgamesh, Deucalion  and more
All defied the longest of odds
And somehow survived the flood sent by the gods

What you might ask, is the answer to this mystery?
And all of humanity’s common history?
And I say that there must be, 
Somewhere, deep down in our psyche
Some terrible fear, some guilty feeling
That all humankind’s double dealing
Goes against  the Natural Intent
And Nature itself on revenge is bent

And so we need this story of destruction and deluge 
And a good couple’s discovery of a tiny refuge
It brings us comfort in some kind of way
To know that we can survive even the dampest doomsday
