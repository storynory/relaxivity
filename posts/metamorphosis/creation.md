The Metamorphoses

My mind is set on stories new and strange  
Of plants, people and things that change  
By whim of gods when they will it so  
Nothing stays the same for long you know.  

Lets begin before the start of time  
Before the poet even thought to rhyme

Before the ocean and the earth appeared  
Before the dark of  night had cleared  
All of nature was one and same  
Empty, Chasmic,  Chaos was its name.

No sun, no moon, no earth, no sky  
No hot, no cold, no  wet, no dry  
All matter mingled in one lump  
One massive, seething, cosmic dump  

But as I said before and was not wrong  
Nothing stays the same for longer
Than a trillion years or so  

One day a god looked down below  
And he or she or it if you prefer  
Considered how all matters were  
Dumped in one unseemly mess  
And seeing the mess, the god felt stressed.  
  
It’s not nature that intended  
for all matters to be upended.  
Let’s tidy up and make it neat  
Sky, earth, sea, that’s complete.

When the world was shining bright and new  
Winds and fogs and morning dew  
Rains and ice and  sunlit rays  
Were gentle, never harsh always,

It was perhaps  a very good start  
But who on earth might appreciate this art?  
One thing was lacking - a being with a mind  
And so the god made human kind.

Maybe you might say it was a big mistake  
Or perhaps, another view you might take  
But let me say that right at the beginning  
The people of earth held back from sinning.
