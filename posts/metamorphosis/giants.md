Now Ovid sometimes is in two minds
About the stories he leaves behind
Hereâ€™s another explanation how
We humans became what we are now.

In the beginning, the World was a land of giants,
Too strong, too full of fury to be clients
of the gods who ruled the world from the sky
Envy, ego, and greed were the reasons why

The giants piled  one mountain upon another
Up, Up Up they climbed for no aim other
Than to reach the gods and fight the divine
Fist to fist, head to head, arms entwine
But to wrestle with gods they had no chance
For Jove took up his lightning lance
And before they reached the eternal heights
Bang! Whiz! He fired them up with holy lights

By Jove this is good.
