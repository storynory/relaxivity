Relaxivity is a new podcast from the makers Storynory. 
This is where you can hear our most mature and sophisticated stories. As the name suggests, the stories are presented in a relaxing and atmospheric style. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t interesting too! We aim to be relaxing and fascinating at the same time! Unwind while you feed your mind. Myths, spirituality and poetry are our main themes. Our music and sound effects enhance the immersive experience. Relaxivity is a special time for yourself.  Pull-on your headphones, put up your feet, lie back and enjoy some Relaxivity.
