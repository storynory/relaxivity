THE GRASSHOPPER
By Anacreon

Hello this is Bertie Fraser

And welcome to the first episode of Relaxivity, a new podcast that brings you relaxing and atmospheric stories - with a sprinkling of verse too.

Our stories have a spiritual and diverting nature, and of course, a good dose of humour.

For our debut, we’ve chosen a short poem from Ancient Greece. The verse celebrates the divine in the small - the little insect that sings the song of summer. Various translations call him a grasshopper, a cicada, or a cricket.  

Cicadas are the chirpy insect that we associate with Greece, but our translation calls our tiny hero a grasshopper.

The ancient Greeks celebrated Cicadas as natural artists.

Socrates, the famous philosopher, whose life was written up by Plato,   taught that Cicadas were once humans.  The Muses enchanted them into singing and dancing for so long they stopped eating and sleeping and died without even  noticing. So The Muses rewarded them with the gift of never needing food or sleep, and of singing from birth to death.

So now you know some background, let's get ready to listen to this enchanting poem, composed some 2,500 years ago.

The Grasshopper, by Anacreon

HAPPY insect! what can be
In happiness compar'd to thee?
Fed with nourishment divine,
The dewy morning's gentle wine!
Nature waits upon thee still,
And thy verdant cup does fill;
'Tis filled wherever thou dost tread,
Nature self's thy Ganymede.
Thou dost drink, and dance, and sing;
Happier than the happiest king!
All the fields which thou dost see,
All the plants belong to thee;
All that summer hours produce;
Fertile made with early juice.
Man for thee does sow and plow;
Farmer he, and landlord thou!
Thou dost innocently joy;
Nor does thy luxury destroy;
The shepherd gladly heareth thee,
More harmonious than he.
Thee country-hinds with gladness hear,
Prophet of the ripen'd year!
Thee Phoebus loves, and does inspire;
Phoebus is himself thy sire.
To thee, of all things upon earth,
Life's no longer than thy mirth.
Happy insect, happy, thou
Dost neither age nor winter know;
But, when thou'st drunk, and danc'd and sung
Thy fill, the flowery leaves among,
(Voluptuous and wise withal,
Epicurean animal!)--
Sated with thy summer feast,
Thou retir'st to endless rest.

And you have been listening to The Grasshopper, written by Anacreon,  And TRANSLATED BY ABRAHAM COWLEY  in the 17th century.

We do hope that you have enjoyed this first episode of Relaxivity and are now feeling nice and relaxed and ready to recharge yourself with positive energy.  

I’ll be back soon with a story from old Japan. And we are working on plenty of mythological stories - all will be revealed soon.

In the meantime, may you maintain good positive energy.

For now, from me, Jana,

Goodbye.
