<p>The Metamorphoses</p>
<p>My mind is set on stories new and strange
Of plants, people and things that change
By whim of gods when they will it so
Nothing stays the same for long you know.</p>
<p>Lets begin before the start of time
Before the poet even thought to rhyme</p>
<p>Before the ocean and the earth appeared
Before the dark of  night had cleared
All of nature was one and same
Empty, Chasmic,  Chaos was its name.</p>
<p>No sun, no moon, no earth, no sky
No hot, no cold, no  wet, no dry
All matter mingled in one lump
One massive, seething, cosmic dump</p>
<p>But as I said before and was not wrong
Nothing stays the same for longer
Than a trillion years or so
One day a god looked down below
And he or she or it if you prefer
Considered how all matters were
Dumped in one unseemly mess
And seeing the mess, the god felt stressed</p>
<p>It’s not nature that intended
for all matters to be upended.
Let’s tidy up and make it neat
Sky, earth, sea, that’s complete.</p>
<p>When the world was shining bright and new
Winds and fogs and morning dew
Rains and ice and  sunlit rays
Were gentle, never harsh always,</p>
<p>It was perhaps  a very good start
But who on earth might appreciate this art?
One thing was lacking - a being with a mind
And so the god made human kind.</p>
<p>Maybe you might say it was a big mistake
Or perhaps, another view you might take
But let me say that right at the beginning
The people of earth held back from sinning.</p>
