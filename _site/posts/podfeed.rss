			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's only natural for parents to worry, and sometimes they worry a little too much. Once, a girl was beautiful - and her parents worried that she was too pretty. They were so concerned that they sent her out into the world with a bowl over her head. Poor girl! How could she find a job? How could she find love? When she had a bowl over her head? People were laughing at her. Even the fairies of the wood thought she was funny. Finally, a kind storyteller and a kind son of a wealthy farmer come into her life. But would she ever take the bowl off her head? That's the question?</p> <p>We think all ages will enjoy this funny, romantic, and only slightly silly story from Japan. And in case you are wondering, the Japanese words at the start are simply 1, 2, 3.</p> <p>Our sources for the story and the picture are The Wooden Bowl Japanese Fairy Tale Series, No. 16 and Japanese Fairy Tales, by Grace James. The story was adapted by Bertie for Storynory and read by Jana. The music is Japanese Souvenir by DeKibo licenced from Premium Beat.</p> <p>We are delighted to dedicate this story to Cora and Margo who support Storynory on Patreon.<a href= "https://www.patreon.com/Storynory">Patreon</a></p>]]></description>

			<itunes:summary>It's only natural for parents to worry, and sometimes they worry a little too much. Once, a girl was beautiful - and her parents worried that she was too pretty. They were so concerned that they sent her out into the world with a bowl over her head.  Poor girl!  How could she find a job? How could she find love? When she had a bowl over her head?   People were laughing at her. Even the fairies of the wood thought she was funny.  Support Storynory on Patreon https://patreon.com/storynory

They tell the tale of a child who was brought up by wolves in the Indian Jungle - and may even be based, rather loosely, on some real-life tales of wolf-kids. If you have ever seen the film by Disney, you will know that Mowgli’s great enemy is Shere Khan, the lame, man-eating tiger. I’m going to be breaking up the text into episodes of about 15 minutes each, otherwise, these are the wonderful words that flowed from the pen of Rudyard Kipling.</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello, this is Natasha, and I’m here with a story about Katie who is a little bit like you.  She goes to school with other ordinary people.  But there’s one thing that is a bit different about her. She’s a witch and can do magic spells. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This story features one of my favourite animals: a deer. Deer are delicate and vulnerable. Down the ages, people have hunted them for their meat which is called venison. They are very good at hiding. They blend into the undergrowth and the woods, and the antlers of the stags look just like branches.  But if they run, they spring and glide through the air so gracefully!  </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well enough about deer, and on with the story. </span></p> <p> </p>]]></description>

He watched his trusty sea captain bring his boat up along the water, and he saw that he was bringing a passenger - a great hulk of a man, dressed in rags. When the boat was near, the sea captain leapt onto the jetty with the rope to moor it and was shortly followed by his passenger.</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Hello,<br /> This is Richard, and I’m here with one of the oldest stories in the world. It is older than even the Bible. Its hero is a great king, warrior, and strongman called Gilgamesh who wanted to discover the secret of immortality or living forever. It was written down around 4000 years ago on clay tablets in letters called Cuneiform when the City of Babylon was at the height of its powers. Babylon was in the part of the world called Mesopotamia, which means between the two rivers, and is in modern-day Iraq. The story goes back even further in time to when a civilisation called the Sumerians ruled Mesopotamia about 6000 years ago.</p> <p>So here is the story of Gilgamesh, based on ancient tales.<br /> chard, at Storynory.com, goodbye.</p>]]></description>

Magic hints from far away Haunt the woodland, and the stream Murmurs in his rocky bed Things that never can be said. Starry dogwood is in flower, Gleaming through the mystic woods. It is beauty's perfect hour In the wild spring solitudes. Now the orchards in full blow Shed their petals white as snow. All the air is honey-sweet With the lilacs white and red, Where the blossoming branches meet In an arbor overhead. And the laden cherry trees Murmur with the hum of bees. All the earth is fairy green, And the sunlight filmy gold, Full of ecstasies unseen, Full of mysteries urntold. Who would not be out-of-door, Now the spring is here once more!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Today they’re going for a dip in the big ocean. “This is going to be so great,” says Little Crab, splish-splashing and squelch-squelching along, all the way to the very edge. Then comes a first glance down at the waves. WHOOSH! Maybe it’s better if they don’t go in?</p> <p>Chris Haughton’s illustrations are clean and modern, and the characters, Little Crab and Very Big Crab are funny and engaging, but what I most love about this book are the gorgeous marine colours - wonderful, vivid turquoises, greens and blues.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>
