<title>Relaxivity: Lanval</title>
<meta name="descripton" content="A romantic tail from the mythological times of King Arthur.  Sir Lanval is a Knight of the Court of King Camelot.  He is brave and good looking, chivalrous, and moral.  But the other Knights of the Round Table do not like him.  So he leaves their company and is wooed by a beautiful fairy queen, who gives him not only her love, but riches too.   The story refers to some grown-up themes. We trust you will find the magical and romantic story calming and diverting from the cares of modern life!  Sit or lie back, and enjoy the story of a medieval Knight. "/>

  <p>A romantic tail from the mythological times of King Arthur.  Sir Lanval is a Knight of the Court of King Camelot.  He is brave and good looking, chivalrous, and moral.  But the other Knights of the Round Table do not like him.  Perhaps his high moral tone irks them.  As a result of his unpopularity, Lanval does not share in the rewards handed out by King Arthur. He falls into poverty, and, in despair, secretly leaves the court.  On his travels he is wooed by a fairy queen, who gives him her love, and riches. The fairy queen makes one condition - he must not mention her to anyone.  When he returns to Camelot, he attracts the eye of Queen Guinevere.  He refuses her advances, and she decides to take revenge, making false accusations against him.   It is based on the Lai of Lanval by Marie de France.</p>
<p>The original was written in Anglo Norman.  Ours is a modern interpretation in easy to understand verse.</p>
<p>The story refers to some grown up themes. We trust you will find the magical and romantic story calming and diverting from the cares of modern life!  Sit or lie back, and enjoy the story of a medieval Knight.</p>
<p>The Lai of Lanval</p>
<p>Lanval, a knight of the court of Camelot</p>
<p>Handsome, Brave, one of the best</p>
<p>Not as famed as Gawain or Lancelot</p>
<p>But perhaps more honest.</p>
<p>He was</p>
<p>Envied</p>
<p>by the rest.</p>
<p>Noone doubted that he was good and true</p>
<p>Fierce in war and kind in peace</p>
<p>Generous and open, they all knew</p>
<p>Constant, steady, no caprice</p>
<p>Only one thing he lacked in its entirety</p>
<p>That slippery quality:  popularity.</p>
<p>For unfortunately,</p>
<p>His nobility</p>
<p>Made other  knights feel</p>
<p>Their moral fragility.</p>
<p>In fact, scheming eyes could not wait</p>
<p>To see him meet some unpleasant fate.</p>
<p>Well, let us begin the story.</p>
<p>Arthur and his knights had spent a while</p>
<p>One summer in the cold city of Carlisle</p>
<p>Up North to fight the troublesome Scots</p>
<p>Who back then were a scrappy lot.</p>
<p>50 days they had fought</p>
<p>The men in kilts</p>
<p>And much blood had spilt</p>
<p>Then the  feast of Pentecost came</p>
<p>and they thought</p>
<p>They had time and cause</p>
<p>To pause their war</p>
<p>And pursuit of glory and immortal fame</p>
<p>And to care, instead, for their bodies and souls.</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>Knights on their knees said their prayers</p>
<p>And sung their psalms</p>
<p>Then escorted ladies on their arms</p>
<p>through the fairs</p>
<p>And clamouring crowds</p>
<p>With much celebration,</p>
<p>Festive feasting, and inebriation</p>
<p>Jousting, music, Dancing</p>
<p>Moonlit walks and talks of love</p>
<p>Sweet kisses and entrancing</p>
<p>For noble Knights knew how to woo</p>
<p>Just as well as to pursue.</p>
<p>That summer was meant to be</p>
<p>A time of plenty.</p>
<p>The King was a man of means</p>
<p>And knights were on the receiving end of things.</p>
<p>If a knight wished to be wed</p>
<p>Arthur set him up with a wife</p>
<p>And homestead</p>
<p>Lands for the gentry</p>
<p>Gold and silver aplenty.</p>
<p>For each loyal knight of the table that was round</p>
<p>Some rich gift had to be found.</p>
<p>Save for one.</p>
<p>Lanval received no lady’s hand</p>
<p>Still less a plot of  land</p>
<p>No gold</p>
<p>No Silver</p>
<p>No bronze</p>
<p>No cloak of ermine did  he don</p>
<p>Lanval alone of all the noble knights</p>
<p>Received</p>
<p>Not a fig</p>
<p>Not a word</p>
<p>Not a nod</p>
<p>He was  forgotten</p>
<p>It was more than odd.</p>
<p>And unfortunately</p>
<p>He was falling, falling into penury</p>
<p>For knighthood demands not just arms and might</p>
<p>It takes money, and plenty, to fight the good fight</p>
<p>Horses and grooms don’t lodge for free</p>
<p>And knights can’t turn away the poor and needy</p>
<p>Without loss of name, fame and nobility</p>
<p>Indeed</p>
<p>Their castle halls are often filled</p>
<p>with the grasping and the greedy</p>
<p>And while they’re away fighting wars</p>
<p>Their stewards steal from their stores</p>
<p>Their cooks guzzle down their wine</p>
<p>And servants help themselves to all that is fine</p>
<p>So one summer night in Carlisle</p>
<p>Lanval awoke</p>
<p>In his bed</p>
<p>Alone</p>
<p>And  broke.</p>
<p>He who knew no fear</p>
<p>Who in battle engaged any enemy</p>
<p>Sweated and felt queer</p>
<p>He could not face his poverty</p>
<p>He groaned.</p>
<p>Far away from home</p>
<p>In a state of lonely distress</p>
<p>At a moonlit hour, he stood up, and dressed.</p>
<p>The forlorn knight</p>
<p>went to find his horse once fine,</p>
<p>Whose mane had lost its shine</p>
<p>Whose neigh had lost its delight</p>
<p>He saddled him up himself</p>
<p>Mounted, and began to ride</p>
<p>Clattering through the half-deserted streets</p>
<p>Past the sleeping retreats</p>
<p>Of Arthur’s men in temporary lodgings</p>
<p>With chests of rich belongings</p>
<p>Who lied</p>
<p>Beside their one-night brides.</p>
<p>He rode out of the city and along the river</p>
<p>Called Eden</p>
<p>Because its banks are so green and fertile</p>
<p>And after he had ridden a while</p>
<p>And after the summer sun had risen in style</p>
<p>He grew hot, and his old horse began to sweat and quiver</p>
<p>And so he lied down in a field beside the cool river</p>
<p>And fell into a deep deep sleep</p>
<p>He was in no hurry</p>
<p>For once, without worry</p>
<p>And when he opened his eyes</p>
<p>He saw, a heavenly surprise,</p>
<p>Two girls, among the loveliest he had seen</p>
<p>Dressed in purple with white lace</p>
<p>Each with a face</p>
<p>That made him feel alive</p>
<p>Like sprinkles of  sweet spring water on his  eyes</p>
<p>“Sir Knight,” one girl  spoke,  “there is a lady who makes no pretence</p>
<p>She is impatient for your attendance</p>
<p>at her side</p>
<p>For if what her heart tells her is right</p>
<p>When  she saw you ride</p>
<p>by her pavillion</p>
<p>It was love at first sight.</p>
<p>So come, and on her fair forehead you may set your gaze</p>
<p>We have reason to think you will be amazed.”</p>
<p>Pavilion? He had not seen any structure made by human hands</p>
<p>He had only ridden past green and pleasant lands.</p>
<p>They led  him by both hands  until</p>
<p>Upon a hill</p>
<p>They came to the lady's tent.</p>
<p>It stood beside an ancient apple tree</p>
<p>Held up by poles of gold and gilded cord</p>
<p>Its sides were made of rich tapestry</p>
<p>Each flap was more than a king could afford</p>
<p>They depicted histories in their scenes</p>
<p>Dido,  the Carthaginian Queen</p>
<p>Cleopatra</p>
<p>Semiramis</p>
<p>Zenobia -</p>
<p>And Sheba of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>inside</p>
<p>He found the lady who had summoned him</p>
<p>Her shapely form</p>
<p>Lying on a bed like bud on a branch in may</p>
<p>The cover she had pushed away</p>
<p>To be the cooler, it was sweltering that summer’s day</p>
<p>All she wore was a slip of silk</p>
<p>He could see</p>
<p>Her neck, her arms, her bosom</p>
<p>All as white as milk</p>
<p>Or a lilly</p>
<p>Or the hawthorn flower.</p>
<p>“Lanval,” she said, in a voice lined with velvet power</p>
<p>“Sweet love,  you are dear to me, so step forward and sit near to me.</p>
<p>I have heard that you are courtly and true.</p>
<p>Because of you</p>
<p>I have journeyed from my land</p>
<p>I understand</p>
<p>That you are rich in honour, honesty and courage</p>
<p>Though despite these precious gifts</p>
<p>You may require a helping hand.</p>
<p>I have no art</p>
<p>I speak from the heart</p>
<p>I love you</p>
<p>And want to help you.”</p>
<p>And when he heard these words</p>
<p>Love struck him like a spark</p>
<p>And desire set  fire to his heart</p>
<p>“Lovely one,” he said.</p>
<p>“Your wish is my command</p>
<p>I will never leave you</p>
<p>I will always believe you</p>
<p>I shall  do anything you demand</p>
<p>Foolish or wise</p>
<p>For you</p>
<p>And only you</p>
<p>Anything you say</p>
<p>It is my greatest joy to obey.”</p>
<p>And when she heard that Sir Lanval was ready to give himself to her</p>
<p>She gave herself to him</p>
<p>Her love and her body</p>
<p>Now at last Lanval was progressing!</p>
<p>And when they had done with their caressing</p>
<p>She offered him another gift:</p>
<p>Anything he might need, no matter what the expense</p>
<p>From henceforth</p>
<p>Make no mistaking</p>
<p>It was his for the taking.</p>
<p>He only had to say</p>
<p>And she would send it his way.</p>
<p>“Do not doubt what I have told you.</p>
<p>My word is as good as gold for you.</p>
<p>No more need to be poor.</p>
<p>So long as you stay true to me</p>
<p>Wealthy, you shall always be”</p>
<p>He thanked her kindly, as you might expect</p>
<p>In one whose manners were so perfect.</p>
<p>But then she added one condition</p>
<p>“You must obey this, my command,  or  suffer the perdition</p>
<p>Of losing me,</p>
<p>My love</p>
<p>My body</p>
<p>And never again will you enjoy my generosity</p>
<p>If one word of our union slips from your lips</p>
<p>Your sorrow will follow swiftly on the morrow.</p>
<p>Mention me, and I’ll be lost to you, you’ll see.</p>
<p>And this is what I truly think:</p>
<p>Your fortunes, once more, will sink.</p>
<p>But my love, there is no need to fret</p>
<p>So long as this one stipulation</p>
<p>You do not forget.”</p>
<p>And when he understood what she wanted</p>
<p>He was quite undaunted.</p>
<p>Sir Lanval did not hesitate to agree</p>
<p>To swear an oath of total secrecy.</p>
<p>And then he closed his eyes</p>
<p>And he would have lied by his lover’s side</p>
<p>For many blissful hours</p>
<p>But instead</p>
<p>She ordered him out of bed</p>
<p>“You can’t stay here,” she said.</p>
<p>The maids came with water and robes</p>
<p>And washed and dressed him in the richest clothes</p>
<p>Then the lovers sat down to dine on fine dishes</p>
<p>And between the dishes</p>
<p>The sweetest kisses.</p>
<p>After dinner, the maids brought him his own horse</p>
<p>Watered, rested and restored to health.</p>
<p>“Lover,” said his lady.  “Any time you miss</p>
<p>My conversation or my kiss</p>
<p>Call me, and say my secret name - which she told him -</p>
<p>And I shall come</p>
<p>Instantly</p>
<p>Invisibly</p>
<p>Save to you</p>
<p>My love who is true.”</p>
<p>So, Sir Lanval</p>
<p>More content than he had ever felt</p>
<p>The picture of confidence and wealth</p>
<p>Was ready to begin</p>
<p>His journey to the nearest inn.</p>
<p>And on his arrival</p>
<p>Before he took his rest</p>
<p>He paid for food and drink for all the guests.</p>
<p>And thereafter,  wherever he went</p>
<p>He freely spent</p>
<p>And no one knew who was this handsome man</p>
<p>Who did not stint</p>
<p>To pay a jailed knight’s ransom</p>
<p>Or to clothe a juggler who was skint.</p>
<p>And no one knew that</p>
<p>It was his secret delight</p>
<p>To call his fairy lover each and every night.</p>
<p>And far as anyway knew</p>
<p>He was alone in his life</p>
<p>And had no lover</p>
<p>Nor a wife.</p>
<p>It was sometime past midsummer’s day</p>
<p>When Sir Lanval was on his way</p>
<p>Little did he know that a lady’s eye</p>
<p>Spied on him as he rode by</p>
<p>She was hidden, but near</p>
<p>In a tower up on high</p>
<p>Her name, was Queen Guinevere</p>
<p>And not so long after, when the days were still hot</p>
<p>Perhaps by chance</p>
<p>But maybe not</p>
<p>Sir Lanval met Sir Gwain in the inn</p>
<p>Sir Gwain greeted him</p>
<p>With open arms</p>
<p>And did not lack for charm</p>
<p>“Sir, we have missed your presence at  my uncle’s court</p>
<p>if there was anything we ought</p>
<p>To have done for you.</p>
<p>Please accept my apology.</p>
<p>It is my feeling we may have wronged you.</p>
<p>It pains me.</p>
<p>I feel the deepest regret.</p>
<p>Believe me.</p>
<p>Sir Lanval.</p>
<p>We did not mean to forget you.”</p>
<p>Generous was the nature of Lanval</p>
<p>And freely, of his own will</p>
<p>Perhaps more than he ought</p>
<p>He found it easy to forgive.</p>
<p>So he returned to court with Sir Gwain forthwith</p>
<p>And if you care for Sir Lanval’s sake</p>
<p>You might feel that this was</p>
<p>His biggest mistake.</p>
<p>So far….</p>
<p>The following Sunday</p>
<p>When the court was supposedly at prayers</p>
<p>The Queen was giving him stares</p>
<p>And at every chance</p>
<p>She sent him the most artful glance</p>
<p>Her intent</p>
<p>And what she meant</p>
<p>Lanval  perceived precisely</p>
<p>But though he liked to treat a lady nicely</p>
<p>There was nothing he might give her</p>
<p>What she wanted,</p>
<p>He could not deliver.</p>
<p>But the more he resisted</p>
<p>The more the queen persisted</p>
<p>Somehow she was always near</p>
<p>To the noble knight whom she found so dear</p>
<p>One day, when he was  alone, in an orchard</p>
<p>deep in thought</p>
<p>She found him, and he was caught.</p>
<p>“Lanval,” she said, temptingly.</p>
<p>“When others neglected you</p>
<p>I always respected you</p>
<p>And then,</p>
<p>When you disappeared</p>
<p>The worst I feared</p>
<p>I could not sleep.</p>
<p>I realised my love for you ran deep.</p>
<p>And  when thankfully you returned</p>
<p>How my passion  sparked and burned!</p>
<p>I am yours for the taking!</p>
<p>Why are you waiting?</p>
<p>This is the season  for our love making! “</p>
<p>But though the queen was ready to give her all</p>
<p>Lanval was not at all enthralled.</p>
<p>He was not like other men she had met</p>
<p>For whom adultery was a step they would not regret.</p>
<p>“My queen,” he said.</p>
<p>“I am flattered with all my being.</p>
<p>I am honoured by all you mention</p>
<p>And thank you for your attention</p>
<p>But please understand</p>
<p>I cannot be your man.</p>
<p>For this reason</p>
<p>It would be treason.</p>
<p>I serve your husband</p>
<p>As his knight, loyal and true</p>
<p>And to wrong him</p>
<p>Would be the very worst</p>
<p>I could do.”</p>
<p>“What is this?” exclaimed the queen.</p>
<p>“You resist my kiss?</p>
<p>Your effete manners I held dear</p>
<p>Now I see how far I was mistaken</p>
<p>My love is forsaken</p>
<p>Because….You, Gallant Knight</p>
<p>Are a queer!</p>
<p>“My lady I assure you I am not.” exclaimed Sir Lanval quite shocked</p>
<p>And well you maybe</p>
<p>To hear the queen speak so plainly</p>
<p>Because back then</p>
<p>And at times even now</p>
<p>The accusation could be</p>
<p>Quite deadly.</p>
<p>“Your lies cannot disguise it any more.</p>
<p>It’s well understood.</p>
<p>That It’s quite common among the brotherhood.</p>
<p>Oh you hunky knights!</p>
<p>I know how you spend those summer nights!</p>
<p>Now it’s clear why you had to disappear</p>
<p>You went off to enjoy</p>
<p>Your  friend</p>
<p>Who is A boy!”</p>
<p>“No no,” pleaded Sir Lanval. “I love another, that much is true.  That is why I cannot be with you. “</p>
<p>“Oh now you make me grieve!</p>
<p>Stop this nonsense - This make-believe!</p>
<p>….Or else,</p>
<p>If what you claim is true</p>
<p>Tell me</p>
<p>Who? Who Is she?</p>
<p>This secret lady</p>
<p>Whom you prefer so much to me!</p>
<p>Much beauty must she posses</p>
<p>But her Identity, I cannot guess.”</p>
<p>“Well, since you ask,</p>
<p>She’s  a lady whose beauty does surpass</p>
<p>All other women I have seen</p>
<p>And that includes you</p>
<p>My queen.”</p>
<p>“Well now. That was a low blow.</p>
<p>Your good manners, Sir Knight,</p>
<p>are not quite what they seem.”</p>
<p>Though it was his courtly code to be polite</p>
<p>When his blood was up,  he was not one to retreat from a fight.</p>
<p>He was far from finished yet.</p>
<p>He had much more to say that he would bitterly regret.</p>
<p>“My lady’s lowliest handmaid</p>
<p>The poorest creature</p>
<p>Of the humblest station</p>
<p>Is more beautifully made</p>
<p>In body, and in face,</p>
<p>And in education</p>
<p>Than you</p>
<p>In fact her whole retinue</p>
<p>Is far exceeding</p>
<p>In manners and in breeding</p>
<p>And In all that is beautiful and true!”</p>
<p>Oh Sir Lanval!</p>
<p>What have you just said?</p>
<p>Not only, have you broken your troth of delicate secrecy</p>
<p>You have all but lost your handsome head.</p>
<p>Surely you should know</p>
<p>That the queen will  NEVER  let a comment like that go?</p>
<p>She is wounded in this verbal fight</p>
<p>But she knows how to pierce her noble knight</p>
<p>No shining armour will protect you.</p>
<p>From the weapons she shall  project at you!</p>
<p>So don’t be taken by surprise</p>
<p>When they start to fly</p>
<p>Those poisoned and pointed lies</p>
<p>This was her track</p>
<p>And her line of attack.</p>
<p>In those dark and mediaeval times</p>
<p>The love of man on man</p>
<p>Was a crime.</p>
<p>And if you were so inclined</p>
<p>Your life was always on the line.</p>
<p>And even if you weren’t</p>
<p>The mere suspicion could get you burnt.</p>
<p>Unless of course you were a lord or a king</p>
<p>Which meant, like now, you could get away with anything.</p>
<p>The queen waited In the bridal room</p>
<p>Where she prepared the most shameless stunt.</p>
<p>She messed up her hair and scratched her own face</p>
<p>She was a right… disgrace.</p>
<p>And when Arthur  returned from the hunt</p>
<p>She was crying</p>
<p>She was sick</p>
<p>And the more she was teerful</p>
<p>The more fearful became the king</p>
<p>“Did you fall? Did you hurt yourself my dear?</p>
<p>You can tell me now, I am here.”</p>
<p>Then she spoke a terrible thing.</p>
<p>She was sick</p>
<p>Because a Knight of the Round Table</p>
<p>Had played an ignoble trick.</p>
<p>Sir Lanval had advanced upon her</p>
<p>And when she commanded him to be gone</p>
<p>And reminded him that she was loyal to only one</p>
<p>He broke down in the most queer tears</p>
<p>And sobbed out his heart to the queen</p>
<p>Like a girl of fourteen</p>
<p>And only then</p>
<p>Did he confess</p>
<p>What they all should have guessed</p>
<p>That what what Sir Lanval was really after</p>
<p>At the court of King Arthur</p>
<p>Was men.</p>
<p>King Arthur was outraged!</p>
<p>How could he let Camalot be so defamed</p>
<p>By the love that dare not speak its name!</p>
<p>What would their enemies say?</p>
<p>They would laugh at them all the way</p>
<p>Into battle</p>
<p>So If this crime could be proved</p>
<p>The stain had to be removed!</p>
<p>A court was swiftly convened</p>
<p>And Lanval was brought before it.</p>
<p>There sat the tearful queen</p>
<p>The King</p>
<p>And all his lords</p>
<p>As well as a curious crowd</p>
<p>All there to see Sir Lanval be demeaned.</p>
<p>The accusation was read out loud</p>
<p>Including</p>
<p>All the dirt that Arthur’s spies could find</p>
<p>All the meanest gossip</p>
<p>That appealed to the lowest minds.</p>
<p>And to this, Lanval replied</p>
<p>The only part  of this accusation that is true</p>
<p>Are the words that I told the queen</p>
<p>That I faithfully serve</p>
<p>A lady</p>
<p>Who is the loveliest I have ever seen.</p>
<p>And every knight who was there</p>
<p>Well knew  that the accusations were unfair</p>
<p>But none of them would dare</p>
<p>To speak in defence of him</p>
<p>When to do so, was to go against the king</p>
<p>Save one</p>
<p>Sir Guain</p>
<p>Who was Arthur’s Brother’s son</p>
<p>“I have always found Sir Lanval to be</p>
<p>A valiant knight</p>
<p>Who has stood firm in many a fight</p>
<p>And who has been</p>
<p>A good friend to me.</p>
<p>But this I do own</p>
<p>He likes to be alone.</p>
<p>And when he stands aloof</p>
<p>Some like to see that as proof.</p>
<p>He thinks that only he is free from sin</p>
<p>And looks down on those around him.</p>
<p>But the mean words that we have heard spoken</p>
<p>Were first meant as a joke</p>
<p>A low attack</p>
<p>A stab</p>
<p>In the back</p>
<p>Of an all round</p>
<p>Good bloke.</p>
<p>But here, today, they are taken seriously as fact.</p>
<p>That can’t be right</p>
<p>Someone needs to take those words back.”</p>
<p>But Sir Gwain’s loyal defence</p>
<p>Only caused the King the greatest offence</p>
<p>“Impudent youth!</p>
<p>It is my wife you accuse</p>
<p>Of playing fast and loose with the truth.</p>
<p>If Lanval’s plea is to be believed</p>
<p>Let him show us the proof.</p>
<p>Where is his lovely lady whom no one else has seen.</p>
<p>Is she some sort of invisible fairy queen? “</p>
<p>Sir Gwain’s keen eyes looked all around</p>
<p>Surely somewhere in this crowd, his friend’s lover could be found?</p>
<p>Whom Sir Lanval was too honourable to name</p>
<p>For to call her, in court, would cause her shame.</p>
<p>And Sir Gwain was soon aware of a suspicous pair</p>
<p>Seated side by side,</p>
<p>Like sisters</p>
<p>Their silken finery could not hide</p>
<p>Their</p>
<p>Features and forms</p>
<p>Most pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>Sir Lanval, he said,  nodding toward the two beauties.</p>
<p>Is one of them your love?</p>
<p>No, replied he, I swear by the Lord above,</p>
<p>I’ve not seen them before.</p>
<p>And soon after, two more arrived,</p>
<p>Whose beauty outshone</p>
<p>Not only the first two,</p>
<p>But all the women who were in view</p>
<p>Eclipsing even the queen</p>
<p>And, it could  be conceived</p>
<p>Every woman who had ever breathed.</p>
<p>And I must say</p>
<p>No Knight of the round table could keep his eyes away.</p>
<p>And each everyone thought</p>
<p>By God!</p>
<p>There must be</p>
<p>Sir Lanval’s lovely lady</p>
<p>And the sort who were more depraved in mind.</p>
<p>Assumed he kept two of the same kind</p>
<p>But instead</p>
<p>Sir Lanval Shook his head</p>
<p>And denied it.</p>
<p>And Arthur</p>
<p>Conscious that his impatient queen</p>
<p>Was restless for justice to be seen</p>
<p>Called on his lords for a guilty verdict</p>
<p>For he thought his case was won.</p>
<p>But the expression on Sir Lanval’s face</p>
<p>Was far from the picture of disgrace</p>
<p>His lips turned up and his eyes shone</p>
<p>For he had spotted his beloved one!</p>
<p>Just in the nick of time she had arrived,</p>
<p>an arabian horse she did ride.</p>
<p>The whole town upon her gazed</p>
<p>And each and everyone was amazed</p>
<p>by her beauty</p>
<p>And her silken finery.</p>
<p>Even the angry king was completely charmed</p>
<p>And all his army was quite disarmed.</p>
<p>Your Majesty, Declared she</p>
<p>I have come to prove your prisoner not guilty!</p>
<p>He never spoke an untrue thing</p>
<p>And has always remained loyal to his king.</p>
<p>Only in one way has he strayed</p>
<p>When he mentioned me, he broke his oath of sacred secrecy</p>
<p>I am the one he has betrayed.</p>
<p>And Sir Lanval fell to his knees and begged his lady please</p>
<p>to forgive.</p>
<p>As Long as he lived</p>
<p>For all his days</p>
<p>He would regret that brash boast that he had made.</p>
<p>“Lanval,’ said she.</p>
<p>I gave you fair warning.</p>
<p>If you mentioned one word of me</p>
<p>Retribution would come for you quite swiftly</p>
<p>And it must be said</p>
<p>You almost lost your head.</p>
<p>The  Jealous Queen got you by the throat</p>
<p>And your comrade knights</p>
<p>Wanted you as their scapegoat.</p>
<p>For every act they have accused you of</p>
<p>They are ten times more guilty</p>
<p>And their greatest sin I see</p>
<p>Is Rank, Stinking Hypocrisy!”</p>
<p>And when I look around this court full of men whom I detest</p>
<p>I still see that you are far better than the rest</p>
<p>So, Lanval, my love,</p>
<p>Mount your horse and follow me.</p>
<p>For I have come to rescue thee.</p>
